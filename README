We are making a shooting gallery for use at a christmas faire.

this is an access-space.org project

The structure will be made from old PC cases and recovered 2x2 wood. The Mechanics and lighting (including 
the IR light for the WiiMotes) are being run on Arduino and the WiiMote interfacing, scoreing, sounds and 
arduino hookup are being handled in Python.




The sounds are all off freesound
